This project contains a ton of Number Theory functions, as well as cryptography functions, including affine, RSA, and ElGamal. In addition, this project supports expression evaluation, supporting defined function calls and variable assignment and usage.<br><br>
The project is written in C++, targeting Windows, and utilizes a modified version of a header only BigInt library by William Chanrico that can be found <a href="https://github.com/williamchanrico/biginteger-cpp">here</a>, as well as some square number check functions utilizing optimizations for, both, integral types and big integers which are credited within the BigInt.h file.<br><br>
Both the RSA and ElGamal encryption and decryption algorithms utilize a specialized table that was specific to the class this project was made alongside of, although there are some variants that don't utilize that table, and the algorithms don't depend on that table in order to work.
