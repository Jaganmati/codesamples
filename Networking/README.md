The contents of this section is a sampling of some of the contents in my solo networking project. The goal of the project was to successfully synchronize physics simulations running independently on separate machines, and to reduce visible lag and "jittery" movement and behavior in high latency environments. I used optimistic replication in order to attempt to meet these goals. Due to this being a sampling, this code should not be expected to compile on its own.<br><br>
Although it isn't clear at first glance, in this project I've wrapped the regular stdout and stderr streams to make them thread safe, and I've included features such as prepending timestamps, and outputting the contents of the stderr stream to a separate file stream, which includes a timestamp which has the date for easier future reference, so all calls std::cout and std::cerr calls throughout the code will not cause the same problems they would otherwise.
