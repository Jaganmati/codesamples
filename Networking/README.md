The contents of this section is a sampling of some of the contents in my solo networking project. The goal of the project was to successfully synchronize physics simulations running independently on separate machines, and to reduce visible lag and "jittery" movement and behavior in high latency environments. I used optimistic replication in order to attempt to meet these goals. Due to this being a sampling, this code should not be expected to compile on its own.
