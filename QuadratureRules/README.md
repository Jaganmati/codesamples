This is a standalone C++ program that implements Midpoint, Trapezoid, and Simpsons Quadrature Rules, as well as Monte Carlo. Each result is paired with the number of iterations the operation took.<br>
I have made a Desmos calculator that shows the mathematical equations that are being performed by each of the rules, except for Monte Carlo, that also shows how close the approximation is to Desmos' solution for the integral, that can be found <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8tq6mf75mz">here</a>.
